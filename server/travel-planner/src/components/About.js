                <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.<br /> 
                Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.<br /> 
                    A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.<br /> 
                    It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>
